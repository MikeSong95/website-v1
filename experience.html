					<h2>IBM - Software QA Development Intern</h2>
					<h3>May 2015 - August 2016</h3>
					<p> My main responsibility was to maintain, fix, and update the automation test platform. This included developing JUnit and Abbott tests, writing scripts to automate test execution, and reporting defects to product owners. I also developed tools used internally to make the testing process more efficient. </p>
					<p> As the QA team was very small, I quickly found myself in a leadership position, organizing and leading the test automation efforts. It was my responsibility to train new interns and employees in regards to test automation. </p>
					<p> Some of my notable projects included:
					<ul>
						<li> A Node.js web server to host and display automation test results using FTP </li>
						<li> A Sails.js test machine reservation web app </li>
						<li> Automated email system to notify product owners of defects </li>
						<li> Expansion of test platform to cover MacOS and Linux </li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Encycle - Software Engineering Intern</h2>
					<h3>May 2014 - August 2014</h3>
					<p> I was on the software team, automating user acceptance tests to run against the client web portal. I also assisted with IT support and participated in both firmware and software smoke tests.</p>
					<p> The tests were written in C# using Selenium, two technologies I was unfamiliar with. I quickly taught myself the fundamentals of both languages, how a scrum team operates, the "best-practices" of test automation, all under minimal supervision and while still adhering to the strict deliverables deadlines. </p>
